## Deliverables

### Code

### Documentation
Carefully document how to set up and run your code as well as what happens where, why and coded by whom. 
Please keep the readability of your documentation in mind. 
Please use the official GitLab Wiki (find it in the left sidebar, very bottom) or READMEs.
Make sure to link your Wiki in your main README, so we find it. 

### Presentation
Please add a PDF version of your slides to the project folder of your GitLab before the final presentation. 

### Report
Please add a PDF and a Tex version of your final report to the project folder of your GitLab before the final presentation. 
You might want to adapt your .gitignore file to not commit LaTex compilation support files. 
Please make sure to submit your 4-page final report in [IEEE conference style](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn).
You can use [TUM Share LaTex](https://latex.tum.de/ldap/login) to collaborate.
