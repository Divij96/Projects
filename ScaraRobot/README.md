## Scara Robot
### Design and build-up of a 4 DoF SCARA like robot (3+1gripper), Intelligent machine design lab
- Mechanical models were designed using Autodesk inventor and built using 3dprinters
- The PCBs were designed using the Autodesk Eagle. They were later on manufactured
and soldered
- Each joint had an Absolute position encoder, a Torque sensor, a BLDC motor, a
gearbox, and a pair of Cross-Roller-Bearings. A master Linux PC with EtherCAT was
used for communication with the joint slaves
- The low-level control was implemented on the Microcontroller chip using C. A highlevel
control was implemented in MATLAB. EtherLab was used as a communication
interface
- The CDTM (Center for Digital Technology Management) supported us regarding the
team communication and project management aspects
