# Projects
## ROS_project_avalanche_rescue
### Search and Rescue avalanche scenario (Mission), Autonomous Systems
- The project was implemented in C++ using ROS packages. Visualization was done in
- Unity environment and Rviz.
- Task: fly over the avalanche and locate victims. Work packages included:-
- • realistic sensor models for avalanche beacon (noise & capabilities)
- • mission planning
- • adaptive trajectory generation
- • location report

## Scara Robot
### Design and build-up of a 4 DoF SCARA like robot (3+1gripper), Intelligent machine design lab
• Mechanical models were designed using Autodesk inventor and built using 3dprinters
• The PCBs were designed using the Autodesk Eagle. They were later on manufactured
and soldered
• Each joint had an Absolute position encoder, a Torque sensor, a BLDC motor, a
gearbox, and a pair of Cross-Roller-Bearings. A master Linux PC with EtherCAT was
used for communication with the joint slaves
• The low-level control was implemented on the Microcontroller chip using C. A highlevel
control was implemented in MATLAB. EtherLab was used as a communication
interface
• The CDTM (Center for Digital Technology Management) supported us regarding the
team communication and project management aspects
